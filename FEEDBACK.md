## Comments

- **Improvement 1**:
  - Description: The website `https://automationexercise.com/` frequently displays ads and popups that interfere with UI tests (e.g., intercepting clicks on the "Signup / Login" link). Suggest adding an ad-blocking mechanism or running tests in an ad-free environment to improve test reliability.

- **Improvement 2**:
  - Description: The API documentation for `/api/verifyLogin` and `/api/createAccount` was unclear, requiring manual inspection of network requests to determine endpoints and expected responses. Providing detailed API documentation (e.g., expected fields, response codes, and error messages) would streamline the testing process.

- **Feedback 1**:
  - Description: The exercise was well-structured and provided a good challenge for testing both UI and API automation. However, the time constraint (4-6 hours) was challenging given the complexities of the website (e.g., ads, redirects, and unclear API docs). Extending the time limit or providing more detailed documentation could make the exercise more accessible.
